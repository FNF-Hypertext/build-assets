builds the assets from vslice (https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/) for html5. It actually build the whole thing but we only need to assets folder so it takes that, builds it, and commits it back

Its slightly differnt than the regular windows build in that it uses mp3 instead of ogg audio, 

Its done automatically this way so that hypertext engine can automatically add new songs when the basegame does

(unless they add new features then that gets hard)
